### Information on Files 
Running the file **model.ipynb** will run the algorithms mentioned in the paper included in this repo. 
Running the file **EDA.ipynb** will run the visualizations to see the analysis of how strain and calories burned affects my sleep and some distributions of recovery and strain scores throughout the week 
Running the **preprocessing.ipynb** will not change anything, since the repo is updated with both datasets in their respective files. However, this allows the viewer to see the preprocessing steps I have taken 
Running the basemodel.ipynb creates some basemodels to gain insights before hyperparamter tunning
